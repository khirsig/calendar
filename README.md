# Simple Flutter Calendar showing Workshops

This repository contains my first app build in Flutter with Dart, which I was asked to do for an internship application.
I never worked with neither Flutter or Dart before, so this was quite exciting to do.

## Description

The task is to write a calendar that is able to show several workshops in different colors.
I went with a basic design with clickable Buttons as days showed in a month view. These days show up to 5 different workshops as small labels in their colors listed below them. If you click on any of those "day buttons" you get more detailed information about all the workshops on that day and at what time they are happening. There is also a legend for each workshop in that month, so that you know what each color means before clicking on any of the days.
